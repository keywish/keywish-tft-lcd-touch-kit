/***********************************************************************
 * When using the BREAKOUT BOARD only, use these 8 data lines to the LCD:
 * For the Arduino Uno, Duemilanove, Diecimila, etc.:
 * D0 connects to digital pin 8  (Notice these are
 * D1 connects to digital pin 9   NOT in order!)
 * D2 connects to digital pin 2
 * D3 connects to digital pin 3
 * D4 connects to digital pin 4
 * D5 connects to digital pin 5
 * D6 connects to digital pin 6
 * D7 connects to digital pin 7
 * For the Arduino Mega, use digital pins 22 through 29
 * (on the 2-row header at the end of the board).

  SD card file dump
 
 This example shows how to read a file from the SD card using the
 SD library and send it over the serial port.
 	
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - pin 4
